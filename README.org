* The PARSE Package

The parse package is a simple monadic parsing library for Common Lisp. It is based on the [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec-3.1.9/docs/Text-Parsec.html|Parsec]] library from Haskell, but it a bit more accessible to Lisp.

It makes use of the [[https://github.com/massung/re|RE]] and [[https://github.com/massung/lexer|LEXER]] packages as well.

** Quickstart

Once loaded, you should be able to quickly begin creating parsers. However, first you'll need a lexer to tokenize your input string. For now, let's create a simple URL parser.
